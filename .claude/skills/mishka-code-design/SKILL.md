description: The Mishka code design guide for adding a feature, fixing a bug, refactoring or starting a new extension in any Mishka Elixir repo (mishka_cms_core, mishka_cms_builder, mishka_cms host, mishka_blog, mishka_document, mishka_cms_migration, mishka_installer, mishka_gervaz, guarded_struct, mishka_chelekom). Use it before writing or changing Elixir code there, even for a small fix: it says how Mishka uses Ash, AshOban, mishka_installer, mishka_gervaz, guarded_struct and Phoenix LiveView, how files and modules are laid out, how code is named and documented, how tests are written, and how commits and PRs go. Use it whenever someone works in these repos, even if they don't mention design or patterns.

# Mishka code design

Mishka code follows one shape across its repos. New code should look like it was always there: the same libraries doing the work, the same file layout, the same names, the same tests. This guide is about **following the pattern that already exists**, not about any one feature.

## Before you write anything

1. **Find the closest existing example and copy its shape.** Look in the repo you're in, then in the other Mishka repos (see "Where to read the code" below). `mishka_cms_core` is the reference for the engine, and `mishka_blog` and `mishka_document` are the references for an extension. Grep for a module that does the same kind of job, such as a resource with tenancy, a change, a worker, a plugin or an admin screen, and follow it.
2. **Reuse before you write.** Ask, in this order:
   - Does Ash, AshOban, AshPostgres or Spark already do this?
   - Does mishka_installer (plugins, events, hooks), mishka_gervaz (admin forms and tables, field types, error display), guarded_struct (input schema) or mishka_cms_core (helpers, settings, permissions) already do it?
   - Does Phoenix or LiveView, including `Phoenix.LiveView.JS`, already do it?

   Write new code only for what none of them does, and say in your report that you checked.
3. **Read the docs for the tools you touch.** That means the relevant Ash guides in `deps/ash/documentation` (and AshOban's, Spark's), the OTP design principles, Elixir's anti-patterns pages, and LiveView's security model when you touch LiveView. The owner's rule is "without knowledge do not do anything". A guess that ignores what the library offers costs a rewrite later.

## Where to read the code

Read each repo in this order. If someone has a local checkout of it, usually a sibling folder (`../<repo>`) next to the one you're in, read that. If the current project depends on it, read `deps/<repo>`. Otherwise read it on GitHub.

- [mishka_cms_core](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka_cms_core): the engine, the reference for core patterns.
- [mishka_blog](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka_blog) and [mishka_document](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka_document): the reference extensions.
- [mishka_cms_builder](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka_cms_builder): the editor.
- [mishka_cms](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka_cms): the host app.
- [mishka_installer](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka_installer): plugins, events, hooks.
- [mishka_gervaz](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka_gervaz): admin forms and tables.
- [guarded_struct](https://github.com/mishka-group/guarded_struct): input schema.
- [mishka_chelekom](https://github.com/mishka-group/mishka_chelekom): UI components.
- [igniter_css](https://github.com/ash-project/igniter_css) and [igniter_js](https://github.com/ash-project/igniter_js): the CSS and JS parsers.
- mishka_cms_migration: the migration extension (private for now).

## How Mishka code is built

- **Ash does the work.** Resources, actions, validations, changes, policies, multi-tenancy, identities (including partial ones), code interfaces, calculations, aggregates, notifiers and transactions all go through Ash. Background jobs use AshOban triggers when they cover what is needed. Signals are for one of our resources reacting to another inside a transaction. Hand-written versions of these are a smell. Details: `references/ash.md`.
- **Plugins and events go through mishka_installer.** An extension point is an installer event. A plugin is a `use MishkaInstaller.Event.Hook` module. Who is installed, and in which order, comes from the installer's own registry (`MishkaInstaller.Event.Event.get(:event, …)`), not from a parallel registry. Other extensions extend yours only through these events. Details: `references/plugins-and-ui.md`.
- **Admin UI is mishka_gervaz.** Forms, tables and error display come from gervaz, never hand-written form markup. Errors an admin can see are short, human sentences rendered through gervaz's error handling. Raw Ash or Postgres dumps go to the log only.
- **Client behaviour is `Phoenix.LiveView.JS` first.** Write a JS hook or a `.js` file only when `JS` truly cannot do the job, and say why.
- **CSS and JS are parsed with real parsers:** `igniter_css` and `igniter_js`, and Tailwind decides which classes exist. Never use regex or a hand-written walker.
- **guarded_struct lives inside the Ash resource** (`guardedstruct do auto_wire true … end`), with nested data as a `sub_field`. Never put it in a separate module plus a change to build it.
- **No backward-compatibility code.** Mishka CMS is at its first release with no outside installs, so design for a fresh install. The mishka.tools site is fixed by hand when needed.

## Shape of the code

- **Layout** (details and a map per repo kind in `references/structure.md`):
  - Unix style: one module per concern, related code kept together in one file, shallow folders.
  - Code used by only one part sits beside it in core's double-underscore folders, e.g. `resources/__changes/x.ex` → `…Resources.Changes.X`, `workers/__helpers/x.ex` → `…Workers.Helpers.X`.
  - Thin wrapper modules get merged away.
- **Names:**
  - Elixir naming, and one fixed vocabulary per repo: never two words for one idea.
  - Modules of the same kind share their entry point and argument order. mishka_installer gives every plugin `call/1`; a helper family gets one public `call`.
- **Pattern matching first:** multi-clause functions, matching in function heads and guards, and `with` for the happy path. Prefer these over `if`, nested `case`, `cond` and `Map.get` chains.
- **Docs, not comments:**
  - Explain in `@moduledoc` and `@doc`, saying what a developer needs to know, never the history of a change. Code comments inside function or action bodies are not the style.
  - Match the repo's existing tone. In mishka_gervaz that means sentence case with no ALL-CAPS lead phrases.
  - Spark DSL docs (`documentation/dsls/DSL-*.md`) are generated with `mix spark.cheat_sheets`, never edited by hand.
- **Dead code:**
  - Delete what nothing uses, including code your own change left behind.
  - Keep a public function that is deliberate API for other developers: it has a real `@doc`, or it is named in the README, guides, usage-rules or CHANGELOG. When unsure, keep it and ask.

## Tests

Tests prove behaviour, not exact output. Each test checks what the code does: a dry run writes nothing, a re-run doesn't duplicate, one site can't see another's data, a user without permission is refused. Assert on results and meaning, not on whole strings or markup.

- **No sleeps, retries, polling loops or longer timeouts.** Wait on the real thing:
  - a sync call to the process (a `GenServer` call returns after its `handle_continue`);
  - `Process.monitor` with `assert_receive {:DOWN, …}`;
  - a message or telemetry event the code sends;
  - running Oban jobs inline.

  A flaky test gets a deterministic fix, proven with `mix test <file> --repeat-until-failure 300`.
- **Test against the real external system.** Mocks replay responses recorded from it.
- **Run only the tests your change touches while working, then the full gate once:** `mix ci` (or the repo's CI alias) and, for Ash repos, a fresh `MIX_ENV=test mix ash.codegen setup && mix test`.

Details and examples: `references/testing.md`.

## Git, commits and PRs

- **One open PR per repo.** New work goes into it as its own commit. Create a branch only when no PR is open: `git switch -c <branch> --no-track origin/master`, then push with `git push -u origin <branch>`.
- **Commits are small:** related files only, staged by explicit path. The message is `type(scope): what the code now does`. Never "step 1", tool names or "findings".
- **PR bodies are short, for the tester:** one row per problem with Before / Now / Test it, then one checks line.
- **CHANGELOG:**
  - The heading is the plain version (`0.0.5`) while `mix.exs` carries the pre-release (`0.0.5-alpha.1`).
  - A first release lists only `- Initial version: [mishka.tools/cms](https://mishka.tools/cms)`.
- **Dependencies are always the newest release.** A PR that touches `mix.exs` or `mix.lock` runs `mix deps.update --all` and `mix hex.outdated --all`.
- **Afterwards:** clean up worktrees, scratch clones and merged local branches. Never merge, release or push to production without the owner's word.

Trailers, model choice, release order and cleanup: `references/workflow.md`.

## When you report

Say what you reused, and from where (path:line). Say what you had to write new, and why nothing existing fit. Give the checks you ran with their results. List anything you judged not worth changing, with a one-line reason.
